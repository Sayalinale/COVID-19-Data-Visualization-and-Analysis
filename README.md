# COVID-19-Data-Visualization-and-Analysis

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data to gain insights into the spread of the pandemic and the impact of vaccination efforts.



1. COVID-19 Case Analysis:
   - Analyzed the progression of COVID-19 cases globally from 2020 to 2022.
   - Created visualizations, including a donut chart and a line chart, to illustrate the total number of cases over time and by country.

2. Geospatial Analysis:
   - Developed a world map visualization showing total COVID-19 cases in each country.
   - Implemented interactivity to display case details when clicking on a specific country.

3. Socioeconomic Analysis:
   - Explored the correlation between a country's GDP per capita and the spread of COVID-19.
   - Created a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between GDP and new cases per million.

4. Vaccination Impact Analysis:
   - Investigated the impact of vaccination efforts on COVID-19 cases and deaths.
   - Plotted lollipop charts to visualize vaccination trends and an area chart to show changes in deaths over time.

5. Geographical Influence Analysis:
   - Explored how geographical proximity influences the spread of COVID-19.
   - Utilized map visualization to illustrate the impact of neighboring countries on case numbers.

 **Implementation Details**

The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the D3.js library for data visualization.



Through this project, valuable insights into the spread of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts have been gained. The interactive visualizations provide a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's dynamics and its socioeconomic implications.
